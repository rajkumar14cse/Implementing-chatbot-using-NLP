# P4-Implementation-of-chatbot-using-NLP
This project, "Chatbot Using NLP," is an intelligent conversational agent designed to understand user inputs and provide meaningful responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The chatbot processes user queries through text preprocessing methods like tokenization and stemming, classifies intents using a trained machine learning model, and generates appropriate responses based on predefined patterns stored in a JSON file. The user interface, built with Streamlit, allows for real-time interaction, making the system user-friendly and interactive. The project demonstrates the practical application of NLP and machine learning in automating conversations, such as customer support or general assistance. With modular design and features like conversation history and customizable intents, the chatbot is scalable and adaptable for future enhancements like multi-turn dialogue, dynamic response generation, and multi-language support.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for implementation.
NLTK: For natural language preprocessing (e.g., tokenization and stemming).
scikit-learn: For intent classification and machine learning tasks.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
JSON: To store and manage chatbot intents and responses

How It Works
User Input: Users enter queries through the web interface.
Text Processing: The input is preprocessed (tokenized, stemmed, and cleaned) using NLTK.
Intent Classification: The processed input is classified into a predefined intent using a scikit-learn model.
Response Generation: Based on the classified intent, a relevant response is retrieved from the intents.json file.
Conversation Logging: Interactions are saved in chat_log.csv for reference and analysis.
